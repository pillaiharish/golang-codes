# Q55. Decide what counts against availability SLOs — worked solution

[Question (try first)](../README.md) · [Error-handling index](../../README.md) · [Go implementation](main.go) · [Tests](main_test.go)

**Level:** Senior | **Concepts:** SLI denominator, client errors, retries.

## Run

From this `solution/` directory:

```bash
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
go run .
```

Go 1.21 or newer is recommended.

## Explanation and trade-offs

An SLO measures a defined user journey: count final user-visible outcomes, not every retry attempt. This illustrative policy counts service-owned 429 rate limits as failed eligible requests, but excludes selected client errors; document cancellation and rate-limit policy explicitly for your product.

## Reference code and tests

Study [main.go](main.go) and [main_test.go](main_test.go) after your own attempt. Explain every failure return, wrapping edge, and caller decision.

### Verify these cases

- 5xx count as failure.
- 400 validation excluded from the example denominator.

## Failure analysis

Modify one error path and predict the failing test. Consider an ignored return, a broken wrapper, a wrong classification, or an unnecessary retry where relevant to this exercise.

## Senior-level explanation

In about one minute: state **decide what counts against availability slos**, the stable caller contract, the trade-off, how you tested the failure path and what you would do differently at a service boundary.
