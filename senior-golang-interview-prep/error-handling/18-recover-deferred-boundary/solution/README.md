# Q18. Recover only in the panicking goroutine — worked solution

[Question (try first)](../README.md) · [Error-handling index](../../README.md) · [Go implementation](main.go) · [Tests](main_test.go)

**Level:** Beginner | **Concepts:** recover, deferred functions, panic boundaries.

## Run

From this `solution/` directory:

```bash
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
go run .
```

Go 1.21 or newer is recommended.

## Explanation and trade-offs

recover only works during unwinding when called directly in a deferred function of the panicking goroutine. Recovery is a last-resort boundary, not a replacement for error values.

## Reference code and tests

Study [main.go](main.go) and [main_test.go](main_test.go) after your own attempt. Explain every failure return, wrapping edge, and caller decision.

### Verify these cases

- Panic value is captured.
- No panic returns nil recovery value.

## Failure analysis

Modify one error path and predict the failing test. Consider an ignored return, a broken wrapper, a wrong classification, or an unnecessary retry where relevant to this exercise.

## Senior-level explanation

In about one minute: state **recover only in the panicking goroutine**, the stable caller contract, the trade-off, how you tested the failure path and what you would do differently at a service boundary.
