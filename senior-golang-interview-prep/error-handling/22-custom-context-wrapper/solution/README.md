# Q22. Implement Error and Unwrap methods — worked solution

[Question (try first)](../README.md) · [Error-handling index](../../README.md) · [Go implementation](main.go) · [Tests](main_test.go)

**Level:** Intermediate | **Concepts:** custom wrapper, Unwrap, nil handling.

## Run

From this `solution/` directory:

```bash
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
go run .
```

Go 1.21 or newer is recommended.

## Explanation and trade-offs

Unwrap exposes the cause to errors.Is/As without requiring callers to know your type. In production, ensure the wrapper has a well-defined non-nil cause.

## Reference code and tests

Study [main.go](main.go) and [main_test.go](main_test.go) after your own attempt. Explain every failure return, wrapping edge, and caller decision.

### Verify these cases

- Message has operation context.
- Underlying sentinel is reachable.

## Failure analysis

Modify one error path and predict the failing test. Consider an ignored return, a broken wrapper, a wrong classification, or an unnecessary retry where relevant to this exercise.

## Senior-level explanation

In about one minute: state **implement error and unwrap methods**, the stable caller contract, the trade-off, how you tested the failure path and what you would do differently at a service boundary.
