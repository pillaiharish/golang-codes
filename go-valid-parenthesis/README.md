# Rune Literals

In Go (Golang), a single quote ' is used to denote a rune literal. A rune represents a Unicode code point and is stored as an int32. Each rune corresponds to a single Unicode character, and unlike strings which are enclosed in double quotes, rune literals are enclosed in single quotes. This allows Go to distinguish between a string (a sequence of characters) and a single Unicode character (a rune). For example, 'a' is a rune containing the Unicode representation of the letter 'a'.
