# Subarray Sums and Range Calculation

In Go, const MOD = 1_000_000_007 defines a constant named MOD with a value of 1,000,000,007. The underscores are used to make the number more readable, but they have no effect on the value. The constant MOD is often used in competitive programming and algorithms to ensure that calculations remain within a manageable range by taking results modulo 1_000_000_007, which is a large prime number. This is particularly useful for preventing overflow and ensuring consistent results when dealing with large numbers.

## Detailed Explanation

### Generating Subarray Sums
We iterate over the array with two nested loops. The outer loop sets the starting index of the subarray, and the inner loop extends the subarray to calculate its sum. Each sum is appended to `subarraySums`.

### Sorting the Sums
We sort the list of subarray sums using `sort.Ints`.

### Calculating the Range Sum
We iterate from `left-1` to `right-1` (because the problem uses 1-based indexing) and calculate the sum of the elements in the sorted list within this range. The result is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent integer overflow and conform to problem constraints.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Generating Subarray Sums**: \(O(n^2)\)
- **Sorting the Sums**: \(O((n^2) \log(n^2))\) which simplifies to \(O(n^2 \log n)\)
- **Range Sum Calculation**: \(O(right - left)\) which in the worst case can be \(O(n^2)\)

The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step: \(O(n^2 \log n)\).

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(n^2)\) due to storing all subarray sums.
