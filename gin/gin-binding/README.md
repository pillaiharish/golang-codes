# Gin Binding
Gin binding is a de-serialization library. 

It supports JSON, XML, query parameter, and more out of the box and comes with a built-in validation framework.

Gin bindings are used to serialize JSON, XML, path parameters, form data, etc. to structs and maps. 

Gin supports various formats by providing struct tags.
